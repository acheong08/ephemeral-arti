    ///
    /// ### Goals and algorithms
    ///
    /// We attempt to maintain a pool of N established and verified IPTs,
    /// at N IPT Relays.
    ///
    /// When we have fewer than N IPT Relays
    /// that have `Establishing` or `Good` IPTs (see below)
    /// and fewer than k*N IPT Relays overall,
    /// we choose a new IPT Relay at random from the consensus
    /// and try to establish an IPT on it.
    ///
    /// (Rationale for the k*N limit:
    /// we do want to try to replace faulty IPTs, but
    /// we don't want an attacker to be able to provoke us into
    /// rapidly churning through IPT candidates.)
    ///
    /// When we select a new IPT Relay, we randomly choose a planned replacement time,
    /// after which it becomes `Retiring`.
    ///
    /// Additionally, any IPT becomes `Retiring`
    /// after it has been used for a certain number of introductions
    /// (c.f. C Tor `#define INTRO_POINT_MIN_LIFETIME_INTRODUCTIONS 16384`.)
    /// When this happens we retain the IPT Relay,
    /// and make new parameters to make a new IPT at the same Relay.
    ///
    /// An IPT is removed from our records, and we give up on it,
    /// when it is no longer `Good` or `Establishing`
    /// and all descriptors that mentioned it have expired.
    ///
    /// (Until all published descriptors mentioning an IPT expire,
    /// we consider ourselves bound by those previously-published descriptors,
    /// and try to maintain the IPT.
    /// TODO: Allegedly this is unnecessary, but I don't see how it could be.)
    ///
    /// ### Performance
    ///
    /// This function is at worst O(N) where N is the number of IPTs.
    /// When handling state changes relating to a particular IPT (or IPT relay)
    /// it needs at most O(1) calls to progress that one IPT to its proper new state.

    ///
    ///  * `Unknown`:

    ///
    ///  * `Uncertain`:
    ///    We have some IPTs we could publish,
    ///    but we're not confident about them.
    ///    We publish these to a particular hsdir if:
    ///     - our last-published descriptor has expired
    ///     - or it will expire soon
    ///     - or if we haven't published since Arti was restarted.
    ///
    /// The idea of what to publish is calculated as follows:

    ///  * If we have at least N `Good` IPTs: `Certain`.

    ///    `Unknown`; otherwise `Uncertain`.
    ///
    /// The effect is that we delay publishing an initial descriptor

    /// at most doubling the initial setup time.
    ///
    /// Each update to the IPT set that isn't `Unknown` comes with a
    /// proposed descriptor expiry time,
    /// which is used if the descriptor is to be actually published.
    /// The proposed descriptor lifetime for `Uncertain`
    /// is the minimum (30 minutes).
    /// Otherwise, we double the lifetime each time,
    /// unless any IPT in the previous descriptor was declared `Faulty`,
    /// in which case we reset it back to the minimum.
    /// TODO: Perhaps we should just pick fixed short and long lifetimes instead,
    /// to limit distinguishability.
    ///
    /// (Rationale: if IPTs are regularly misbehaving,
    /// we should be cautious and limit our exposure to the damage.)
    ///
    /// \[1\] NOTE: We wait a "short time" between establishing our first IPT,
